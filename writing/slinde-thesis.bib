Consistent with this prediction, we find that when beginning-of-period proxies for sentiment are low, subsequent returns are relatively high for small stocks, young stocks, high volatility stocks, unprofitable stocks, non-dividend-paying stocks, extreme growth stocks, and distressed stocks. When sentiment is high, on the other hand, these categories of stock earn relatively low subsequent returns.},

These measures are known to be highly persistent, but also to be noisy estimates of the underlying integrated variance. Recently, Bollerslev, Patton and Quaedvlieg (2016, Journal of Econometrics, 192, 1-18) exploited this fact to extend the commonly used Heterogeneous Autoregressive (HAR) by letting the model parameters vary over time depending on estimated measurement errors and show that their model leads to improved forecasts. We propose an alternative specification that allows the autoregressive parameter of the HAR model for volatilities to be driven by a latent Gaussian autoregressive process that potentially also depends on the estimated measurement error. The model can be estimated straightforwardly using the Kalman filter. Our empirical analysis considers the realized volatilities of 40 stocks from the S\&P 500 estimated using three different observation frequencies. Our specification allows for more flexible time-varying parameters than existing approaches and consequently provides a better model fit. Furthermore, our preferred model based on the logarithm of realized volatility including a function of realized quarticity generates superior forecasts and consistently outperforms the competing models in terms of different loss functions and for various subsamples of the forecasting period.},

For example, our models can allow for strong persistence when the measurement error is small, and weaker persistence when the measurement error is large. Using data on the S\&P500 equity index and 27 individual firms over the period 1997-2013, we show that exploiting information about time-varying measurement error leads to significantly better forecast performance.},

In this paper, I compare the predictive performance of feed-forward and recurrent neural networks (RNN), particularly focusing on the recently developed Long short-term memory (LSTM) network and NARX network, with traditional econometric approaches. The results show that recurrent neural networks are able to outperform all the traditional econometric methods. Additionally, capturing long-range dependence through Long short-term memory and NARX models seems to improve the forecasting accuracy also in a highly volatile framework.},

By conducting a time series validation we find that both Ridge regression and FNN can improve volatility indexing with higher prediction performance and fewer options required.

The MIDAS framework allows us to compare regressions across all these dimensions in a very tightly parameterized fashion. Using equity return data, we find that daily realized power (involving 5-min absolute returns) is the best predictor of future volatility (measured by increments in quadratic variation) and outperforms models based on realized volatility (i.e. past increments in quadratic variation). Surprisingly, the direct use of high-frequency (5min) data does not improve volatility predictions. Finally, daily lags of 1\textendash 2 months are sufficient to capture the persistence in volatility. These findings hold both in- and out-of-sample.},

We provide a comprehensive investigation of the risk dynamics of the Bitcoin Market from a realized volatility perspective. The Bitcoin market is extremely risky in the sense of volatility, entangled jumps, and extensive consecutive jumps, which reflect the major incidents worldwide. Empirical study shows that the lagged realized variance increases the future realized variance, while the jumps, especially positive ones, significantly reduce future realized variance. The out-of-sample forecasting model reveals that, in terms of forecasting accuracy and utility gain, investors interested in the long-term realized variance benefit from explicitly modelling the jumps and signed estimators, which is unnecessary for the short-term realized variance forecast.},

They also demonstrated the importance of using accurate equity risk models and having a risk management function able to implement effective hedging strategies. Stock volatility forecasts play a key role in the estimation of equity risk and, thus, in the management actions carried out by financial institutions. Therefore, this paper has the aim of proposing more accurate stock volatility models based on novel machine and deep learning techniques. This paper introduces a neural network-based architecture, called Multi-Transformer. Multi-Transformer is a variant of Transformer models, which have already been successfully applied in the field of natural language processing. Indeed, this paper also adapts traditional Transformer layers in order to be used in volatility forecasting models. The empirical results obtained in this paper suggest that the hybrid models based on Multi-Transformer and Transformer layers are more accurate and, hence, they lead to more appropriate risk measures than other autoregressive algorithms or hybrid models based on feed forward layers or long short term memory cells.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the volatility of Bitcoin and determines the importance of jumps and structural breaks in forecasting volatility. Using high-frequency data, we perform a model-free decomposition of realized variance into its continuous and discontinuous components, positive and negative semivariances, signed jumps and leverage components. We show the importance of this decomposition in the in-sample regressions using eighteen competing heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) models. In the out-of-sample setting, we find that the HARQ-F-J model is the superior model, indicating the importance of the temporal variation and squared jump components at different time horizons. We also show that the HAR models with structural breaks outperform models without structural breaks across all forecasting horizons. Our results are robust to an alternative jump estimator and estimation method.},

Given the unique features of the crypto asset market, we find that conventional regression models exhibit strong model specification uncertainty. To circumvent this issue, we suggest using least squares model-averaging methods to model and forecast Bitcoin volatility. The empirical results demonstrate that least squares model-averaging methods in general outperform many other conventional regression models that ignore specification uncertainty.},
